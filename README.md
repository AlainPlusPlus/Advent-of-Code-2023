Quick and creative puzzle solving programming exercises.
Each program in this repository provides solutions to the daily puzzles of the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

## How to run the program using GCC
The easiest way to compile and run this (and any) C program on most Operating Systems is using [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org) (GNU Compiler Collection). Instructions on how to install GCC can be found [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/index.html).

After installing GCC, the program can be compiled and ran on the terminal using the following commands:

$ gcc -o day1  day1.c
$ ./day1 < [INPUT_FILE]
